                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  The global adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, yet the practical accessibility of those assets remains a major challenge. One of the most significant pain points in crypto today is the inability to easily withdraw funds from centralized exchanges without relying on unreliable or risky P2P transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  XCoinpay is a blockchain solution built from the ground up to solve this problem â€” offering instant, low-fee, P2P-free crypto withdrawals at scale. At its core, XCoinpay is designed for speed, security, and utility, with a native ecosystem of tokens that rewards users and drives real-world value.
                </p>

              <section>
                <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dependence on P2P platforms that are slow, unregulated, and often unsafe</li>
                  <li>Inconsistent liquidity and regional limitations</li>
                  <li>High risk of scams and disputes</li>
                  <li>Delays in fund transfers and confirmations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  As a result, users experience frustration, capital inefficiency, and avoidable financial risks â€” undermining the promise of crypto as a fast and borderless financial system.
                </p>
